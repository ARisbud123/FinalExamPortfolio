## Overview

An application with a functionality to read a customer's Energy Bill, summarize the main points, and provide actionable recommendations through an interactive ChatBot.

## Why Energy Bill Analyzer

In today's world, around 80% of energy comes from fossil fuel, which emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases extremely harmful to our planet. In particular, throughout the United States, there is a problem with the usage of energy, with most people overconsuming and not understanding their personal carbon footprint and impact on their surrounding environment. Our application is built to combat this environmental concern through the usage of Generative AI. The specific features are listed below:

#### File Scanner
- Allows for the user to upload their Energy Bill, which the application stores locally and scans, summarizing all of the key features in a comprehensive and easy-to-understand manner.

#### Text-to-Speech
- Once the file is uploaded, the user is able to have the file and all its summarized points be spoken aloud.
- This particular feature is implemented with accessibility in mind, gearing towards those who are hard-of-sight, or are not able to fluently read English

#### Follow-up Quesstions
- Through the use of the ChatBot functionality, users are able to ask follow up questions to the AI regarding their energy bill consumption, their bill, and how they can reduce their carbon footprint while also saving money in doing so.

I personally worked on this demo video alongside another team mate, compiling the work done as a team and creating an easy to view and understand video to showcase during our presentation.
